This is a prototype board for the 2021 ESRA Payload. We are planning on developing a parafoil guided payload that will be ejected from the rocket at apogee, and guide itself to landing. 

Capabilities of this board include: 
  6 Servo Outputs
  4 External IO 
  High Acceleration Accelerometer (H3LIS331DLTR)
  9 Axis IMU (ICM-20948) 
  LORA Radio (RFM98) 
  Barometer (BMP388) 
  18V Max Input
  Battery Voltage Reader
  Various LEDs for status 
  
  
This board should be used on the scale test payload we are developing, and will be a proof of concept for the final ESRA payload we will develop after validating this design.
